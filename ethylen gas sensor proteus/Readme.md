This is ethylene gas detector proteus project. 
The variable resistor adding to testing pin in gas sensor. 
Using that mq135 gas sensor beacuse cannot find the Me3-c2h4 Electrochemical ethylene gas sensor library.
The mapping function is not in that code. 
But the tinckercad application is including all the mapping function.

instruction-

Arduino code hex file include to arduino nano program file location.
Gas sensor hex file in gas sensor folder include to gas sensor program file location.
